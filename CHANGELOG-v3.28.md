## ðŸ”§ Fix: Delivery Method Scheduling Logic

### Issue Fixed
**Problem:** When a configuration has delivery method "BOTH", the future QR scheduling section wasn't appearing when sellers selected "Direct Email" option. The scheduling would only show when the configuration was set to "DIRECT" exactly.

**Root Cause:** The scheduling visibility condition was checking `config?.button3DeliveryMethod === 'DIRECT'` which failed when the config was set to 'BOTH'.

### Solution Implemented
- **Added `shouldShowScheduling()` helper function** to properly handle scheduling visibility logic
- **Fixed scheduling behavior** for all delivery method combinations:
  - `'DIRECT'` config â†’ Show scheduling âœ…
  - `'BOTH'` config + user selects "Direct Email" â†’ Show scheduling âœ… (Fixed!)
  - `'BOTH'` config + user selects "Landing Page URLs" â†’ Hide scheduling âœ… 
  - `'URLS'` config â†’ Hide scheduling âœ…

### Technical Changes
**File:** `app/seller/page.tsx`
- Added `shouldShowScheduling()` helper function with proper logic for all delivery method scenarios
- Updated scheduling section condition from hardcoded check to use helper function
- Updated step numbering logic to use new helper function
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations

### User Experience Impact
- âœ… **Fixed:** Sellers can now schedule QRs when using "BOTH" delivery method with "Direct Email" selected
- âœ… **Correct behavior:** Scheduling properly hides when "Landing Page URLs" is selected (since scheduling only works with direct email delivery)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Improved UX:** Step numbering automatically adjusts based on which sections are visible

### Testing
- Configurations with delivery method "DIRECT" â†’ Scheduling works (existing)
- Configurations with delivery method "BOTH" + "Direct Email" selected â†’ Scheduling now appears (fixed)
- Configurations with delivery method "BOTH" + "Landing Page URLs" selected â†’ Scheduling correctly hidden
- Configurations with delivery method "URLS" â†’ Scheduling correctly hidden (existing)
