# ELocalPass v3.35.47 - Server-Side Sorting Fix

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes

### Fixed Pagination Sorting Issue
- **Issue**: Sorting only worked within current page (25/50/100 items), not across all 476 affiliates
- **Root Cause**: Client-side sorting was applied after server returned paginated subset of data
- **Solution**: Implemented server-side sorting in the API
  - Added `sortField` and `sortDirection` parameters to affiliates API endpoint
  - Modified frontend to include sorting parameters in API requests
  - Updated useEffect to trigger API call when sorting changes
  - Removed client-side sorting logic since server now handles it
- **Result**: Sorting now works correctly across all affiliates regardless of page size
  - When on 25 items per page, clicking "No." column properly sorts all 476 affiliates numerically
  - First page shows affiliates #1, #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, etc. (proper numerical order)
  - Previously would only sort the random 25 affiliates that happened to be on current page

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX: Numerical Sorting for Affiliate Numbers
- **Issue**: Affiliate numbers were still being sorted alphabetically instead of numerically
- **Problem**: Database was returning: 1, 10, 100, 101, 102, 103, 11, 110, 111, 112, 12, 120...
- **Root Cause**: `affiliateNum` field stored as string in database, Prisma was doing string sorting
- **Solution**: Added special handling for `affiliateNum` field
  - When sorting by affiliate number, fetches all data first
  - Sorts numerically in JavaScript by converting strings to integers
  - Handles null/invalid numbers by putting them at the end
  - Applies pagination after proper numerical sorting
- **Result**: Now correctly sorts as: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 100, 101, 102, 103...
- **Performance**: Only affects affiliate number sorting; other fields use efficient database sorting

### ðŸŽ¯ Column Width Optimization & Resizing Fixes
- **Issue**: Some columns were difficult or impossible to resize, and default widths were too wide
- **Solution**: Comprehensive column width and resizing improvements
  - **Default Widths**: Updated to match header text width + padding (e.g., "EMAIL" = 60px, "BUSINESS NAME" = 120px)
  - **Resize Handles**: Made wider (2px instead of 1px) for easier grabbing
  - **Hit Areas**: Increased invisible hit area to 6px for better usability
  - **Visual Feedback**: Added blue gradient indicator on hover to show resize capability
  - **Z-Index**: Improved layering (z-50 for handles) to prevent interference
  - **Persistence**: Column widths are saved using useUserPreferences hook and persist across sessions
- **Result**: All columns now properly resizable with intuitive visual feedback
- **User Experience**: More compact default layout with easy customization ability

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details

### Frontend Changes (`app/admin/affiliates/page.tsx`)
- Added `sortField` and `sortDirection` to API request parameters
- Updated `loadAffiliates` function to include sorting in URL params
- Added sorting parameters to useEffect dependency array
- Removed complex client-side sorting logic (35+ lines)
- Simplified to use server-sorted data directly
- **NEW**: Optimized `defaultColumnWidths` to match header text
- **NEW**: Enhanced `ResizableHeader` component with better resize handles
- **NEW**: Added visual indicators for column resizing capability
- **NEW**: Improved z-index layering and hit areas for resize handles

### Backend Changes (`app/api/admin/affiliates/route.ts`)
- Added sorting parameter extraction from request URL
- Implemented dynamic `orderBy` clause construction
- **NEW**: Added special numerical sorting for `affiliateNum` field
- **NEW**: Conditional logic to handle string-to-number conversion for affiliate numbers
- **NEW**: Proper handling of null/invalid affiliate numbers (sorted to end)
- Maintained default sorting (active first, most visits, name) when no sort specified
- Added debug logging for sorting parameters

## ðŸš€ Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Eliminates client-side sorting overhead
- **Positive**: Proper database-level sorting is more efficient for most fields
- **Neutral**: Affiliate number sorting requires full dataset fetch (only when sorting by affiliate number)
- **Positive**: Consistent sorting behavior across all page sizes
- **Positive**: More compact default layout reduces initial load time

## ðŸ“Š Verification
- âœ… Tested with 25, 50, 100, and 500 items per page
- âœ… Confirmed sorting works identically across all page sizes
- âœ… Verified affiliate numbers sort in proper numerical order (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12...)
- âœ… Confirmed other columns (name, email, etc.) sort correctly across pages
- âœ… Fixed alphabetical sorting issue (1, 10, 100, 101, 11, 12...)
- âœ… Verified all columns can be resized by dragging handles
- âœ… Confirmed column widths persist after page refresh
- âœ… Tested resize functionality across different column types
