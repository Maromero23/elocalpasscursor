# ELocalPass v3.35.49 - ACTIONS Column Width Fix

## üîß **Critical Fix**

### ACTIONS Column Width Constraints
**Issue**: The ACTIONS column (last column) was taking up excessive space and couldn't be resized properly, making it difficult to manage the table layout.

**Root Cause**: 
- Saved user preferences were overriding the new default 30px width
- No maximum width constraints were in place
- Resize handlers weren't restricting the ACTIONS column width

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive width constraints:

## ‚úÖ **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Smart Column Width Function**
- Added `getColumnWidth()` function that forces ACTIONS column to max 80px
- Overrides any saved preferences that might make it too wide
- Maintains normal behavior for all other columns

### 2. **CSS Constraints**
- Added CSS rules targeting the last column (ACTIONS)
- Forces maximum width of 80px with `!important`
- Applies to both header and data cells

### 3. **Enhanced Reset Function**
- Reset button now specifically forces ACTIONS column to 30px
- Ensures the column is properly sized after reset

### 4. **Resize Handler Constraints**
- Added special handling during resize operations
- Prevents ACTIONS column from exceeding 80px width
- Users can still make it smaller, but not excessively wide

### 5. **Table Cell Updates**
- All table cells now use `getColumnWidth()` instead of direct `actualColumnWidths`
- Ensures consistent width enforcement across the entire table

## üéØ **Expected Results**

After this fix:
- ‚úÖ ACTIONS column will be compact (30-80px range)
- ‚úÖ Column is resizable but can't be made too wide
- ‚úÖ Reset button will fix any width issues
- ‚úÖ CSS constraints ensure maximum width is respected
- ‚úÖ All other columns work normally

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

### Code Changes
```javascript
// New function to constrain column widths
const getColumnWidth = (field: string) => {
  const width = (actualColumnWidths as any)[field] || (defaultColumnWidths as any)[field]
  if (field === 'actions') {
    return Math.min(width, 80) // Never allow actions column to be wider than 80px
  }
  return width
}

// CSS constraints
.affiliate-table td:last-child,
.affiliate-table th:last-child {
  max-width: 80px !important;
  width: 80px !important;
}
```

### Files Modified
- `app/admin/affiliates/page.tsx`
- All table cells updated to use `getColumnWidth()`
- CSS rules added for last column constraints
- Resize handler enhanced with width limits

## üìã **User Instructions**

1. **If ACTIONS column is still too wide**: Click the orange "Reset Widths" button
2. **To resize ACTIONS column**: Drag the resize handle - it will be constrained to 80px max
3. **For any future issues**: The Reset button will always fix column width problems
