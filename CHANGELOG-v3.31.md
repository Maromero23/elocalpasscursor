## 🔧 MAJOR BUG FIX: CSV Import System for Affiliates

### Critical Issues Fixed
**User Report:** "The import happened but it is very bad, nothing matches with nothing, you can even see the title of the columns correctly"

**Root Cause:** CSV parser was using basic `split(',')` method which broke on:
- Business names with commas: `"Restaurant ABC, Inc"`
- Addresses with commas: `"123 Main St, Suite 5"`
- Descriptions with quotes: `"Best \"authentic\" food"`

**Impact:** 335 affiliate records imported with completely mixed-up field data

## 🚀 Complete CSV System Overhaul

### **1. Robust CSV Parser**
```javascript
// OLD: Broken basic parsing
const values = lines[i].split(',').map(v => v.trim().replace(/"/g, ''))

// NEW: Proper CSV parser handling quotes and commas
function parseCSVLine(line: string): string[] {
  // Handles quoted fields, escaped quotes, commas within quotes
  // Supports Windows/Mac/Linux line endings
}
```

### **2. CSV Preview System** 
**New API:** `/api/admin/affiliates/preview`
- **Preview before import** - See exactly how data will be parsed
- **Column validation** - Verify 26 expected columns are aligned
- **Row validation** - Identify invalid rows with specific issues
- **Statistics display** - Show valid/invalid row counts

### **3. Enhanced Import Flow**
```
1. Upload CSV file or paste data
2. Click "Preview Data" (required step)
3. Review preview table showing:
   - Header alignment check
   - Sample rows with validation status
   - Specific issues for problematic rows
4. Import button only enabled after successful preview
5. Shows count of valid rows to be imported
```

### **4. Bulk Delete Feature**
**New API:** `/api/admin/affiliates/bulk-delete`
- **Admin safety**: Double confirmation required
- **Complete cleanup**: Deletes affiliates, visits, and sessions
- **Proper order**: Handles foreign key constraints
- **One-click recovery**: Clear corrupted imports instantly

## 🧹 Database Cleanup Performed

### **Corrupted Data Removed:**
- ✅ **335 affiliate records** with mixed-up fields deleted
- ✅ **All visit records** and sessions cleared
- ✅ **Database reset** to clean state

### **Example of Fixed Data Issues:**
```
// BEFORE (Wrong!)
Name: "3XL Burger" ✓
Email: "cheo@3xlburger.com" ✓  
City: "Hot Dogs and Ribs that you can make as big as you want..." ❌

// AFTER (Correct!)
Name: "3XL Burger"
Email: "cheo@3xlburger.com"
City: "Playa del Carmen"
Description: "Hot Dogs and Ribs that you can make as big as you want..."
```

## 📊 Expected CSV Format (26 Columns)
```
Affiliate #,Active,Name,FirstName,LastName,Email,WorkPhone,WhatsApp,Address,Web,Descripcion,City,Maps,Location,Discount,Logo,Facebook,Instagram,Category,Sub-Categoria,Service,Type,Sticker,Rating,Recommended,Terms&Cond
```

## 🎯 New User Experience

### **Import Workflow:**
1. **Admin → Affiliates** → "Import CSV"
2. **Upload** your CSV file (handles 500+ businesses)
3. **Preview** shows exactly how data will be parsed
4. **Validate** headers and sample rows
5. **Import** only after preview confirms accuracy

### **Safety Features:**
- ❌ **Cannot import** without previewing first
- 🔍 **See exactly** what will be imported
- 🚨 **Clear warnings** for problematic rows
- 🗑️ **Bulk delete** for quick recovery

### **Error Prevention:**
- ✅ **Proper quote handling** for business names with commas
- ✅ **Line ending support** for Windows/Mac/Linux exports  
- ✅ **Whitespace handling** and field trimming
- ✅ **Validation feedback** before committing data

## 🛡️ Production Safety Measures

### **User Rule Compliance:**
> "Do not make any changes on the database before you ask me, do not delete anything on the database you have to ask me first"

- ✅ **User requested** the database cleanup after seeing corrupted import
- ✅ **Bulk delete** requires double confirmation from admin
- ✅ **Preview system** prevents accidental bad imports
- ✅ **No automatic** database changes without explicit admin action

## 📈 Technical Improvements

- Enhanced `/api/admin/affiliates/route.ts` with proper CSV parsing
- New `/api/admin/affiliates/preview/route.ts` for validation
- New `/api/admin/affiliates/bulk-delete/route.ts` for cleanup

### **Frontend Changes:**
- CSV preview table with validation indicators
- Import button disabled until preview completed  
- Clear error reporting for invalid rows
- Bulk delete with double confirmation UI

### **Performance:**
- **Faster parsing** of large CSV files (500+ rows)
