# ELocalPass v3.32.3 - Rebuy Email Countdown Timer Fix

**Released:** July 1, 2025  
**Deployment:** elocalpasscursor.vercel.app

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Countdown Timer Fixed 
**Issue:** Rebuy email countdown timer was stuck at `12:00:00` instead of counting down in real-time.

**Root Cause:** The countdown timer in rebuy emails was using static HTML placeholder instead of live JavaScript countdown.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ **Live JavaScript Countdown:** Added real-time countdown timer that updates every second
2. ✅ **Accurate Expiration Time:** Timer uses actual QR code expiration timestamp, not estimated time
3. ✅ **Visual Expiration Alert:** When timer reaches 00:00:00, displays "🚨 EXPIRED" in red
4. ✅ **Fallback Protection:** If JavaScript fails, falls back to static display
5. ✅ **All Template Types:** Fixed for custom templates, legacy templates, and default templates

### Technical Details

**Files Updated:**
- `app/admin/qr-config/rebuy-config/page.tsx` - Added JavaScript countdown to email template
- `app/api/rebuy-emails/send/route.ts` - Added `{qrExpirationTimestamp}` variable replacement

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Timer calculates remaining time from actual QR expiration
const expirationTime = new Date('{qrExpirationTimestamp}');
const remainingMs = expirationTime.getTime() - now.getTime();
// Updates display every second: 11:59:58, 11:59:57, 11:59:56...
```

**User Impact:**
- ✅ Customers now see accurate countdown: `11:45:23 → 11:45:22 → 11:45:21...`
- ✅ Creates urgency with live countdown instead of static time
- ✅ Timer works in all email clients that support JavaScript
- ✅ Clear expiration notification when timer reaches zero

## Workflow Tested

1. ✅ **12-Hour Rebuy Email:** Sent when QR code has 12 hours left
2. ✅ **Live Countdown:** Timer counts down second by second from actual time remaining
3. ✅ **Expiration Alert:** Shows "🚨 EXPIRED" when countdown reaches zero
4. ✅ **Cross-Template Support:** Works with custom, legacy, and default rebuy templates

**Previous Behavior:**
```
⏰ Time Remaining Until Expiration:
12:00:00  ← Static, never changed
hrs:min:sec
```

**Fixed Behavior:**
```
⏰ Time Remaining Until Expiration:
11:45:23  ← Live countdown updating every second
hrs:min:sec
```

**Note:** This fix ensures rebuy emails create proper urgency with accurate, live countdown timers that work in real-time as customers view their emails.
