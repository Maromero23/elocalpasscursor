# ELocalPass v3.39.65 - Simplify Scheduled QR Date Handling

## ðŸ”§ Critical Fix: Eliminate Date Reconstruction Complexity

### Simplified Scheduled QR Date Handling
**Issue**: Despite previous fixes, scheduled QR codes were still being created one day later than selected (July 23 â†’ July 24).

**Root Cause**: Over-complicated date reconstruction logic in `scheduleQRCode` function was introducing timezone conversion issues even after attempting to fix them.

**Solution**: Eliminate date reconstruction entirely and use stored date directly.

## âœ… Changes Made

### Simplified Date Logic:
- âœ… **Removed Complex Reconstruction**: Eliminated all date parsing and reconstruction logic
- âœ… **Direct Date Usage**: Use `orderRecord.deliveryDate` directly as it's already processed correctly in POST handler
- âœ… **Cleaner Code**: Reduced 30+ lines of complex logic to simple direct usage
- âœ… **No Timezone Issues**: Eliminates all potential timezone conversion problems

**Before v3.39.65**:
```javascript
// Complex reconstruction with potential timezone issues
const storedDate = new Date(orderRecord.deliveryDate)
const year = storedDate.getFullYear()
const month = storedDate.getMonth() + 1
const day = storedDate.getDate()
const isoString = `${year}-${month}...` // 30+ lines of reconstruction
```

**After v3.39.65**:
```javascript
// Simple and direct - no reconstruction needed
deliveryDateTime = new Date(orderRecord.deliveryDate)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Insight

The `orderRecord.deliveryDate` is already processed correctly in the POST handler with proper Cancun timezone offset. No reconstruction is needed - just use it directly.

**Deployment Notes**: This simplified approach eliminates the root cause of date shifting by avoiding unnecessary date reconstruction entirely.
