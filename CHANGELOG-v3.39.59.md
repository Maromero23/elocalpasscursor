# ELocalPass v3.39.59 - PayPal Scheduled QR Timezone Fix

## 🕐 Critical Fix: PayPal Scheduled QR Timezone Issue

### Fixed PayPal Scheduled QR Timezone Bug
**Issue**: PayPal scheduled QR codes were showing incorrect times in the admin dashboard due to timezone mismatch between user's intended Cancun time and server timezone.

**Root Cause**: The PayPal payment system was using `new Date(year, month - 1, day, hours, minutes, 0)` which creates dates in the server's timezone instead of Cancun timezone.

**Example of the Problem**:
- **User schedules**: 4:30 PM July 23 (Cancun time)
- **System created**: 4:30 PM July 23 (server timezone)  
- **Admin dashboard showed**: 11:30 AM July 23 (5-hour difference)

## 🎯 Technical Solution

### Updated PayPal Date Creation Logic:

**Before v3.39.59**:
```javascript
deliveryDateTime = new Date(year, month - 1, day, hours, minutes, 0)
```

**After v3.39.59**:
```javascript
const isoString = `${year}-${month.toString().padStart(2, '0')}-${day.toString().padStart(2, '0')}T${hours.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${minutes.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:00.000-05:00`
deliveryDateTime = new Date(isoString)
```

## ✅ Files Modified

### PayPal Success Route (`app/api/paypal/success/route.ts`):
1. **GET handler**: Fixed timezone conversion for return URL processing
2. **POST handler**: Fixed timezone conversion for webhook processing  
3. **scheduleQRCode function**: Fixed both date+time and date-only scenarios

### Changes Made:
- ✅ **Explicit Cancun Timezone**: All dates now use `-05:00` offset
- ✅ **Consistent Handling**: Both date+time and date-only scenarios fixed
- ✅ **Multiple Entry Points**: Fixed GET, POST, and scheduling functions
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added timezone-aware debug information

## 🧪 Fix Results

**Before v3.39.59**:
- ❌ User schedules 4:30 PM → Shows 11:30 AM in admin
- ❌ Timezone mismatch between user intent and system storage
- ❌ 5-hour discrepancy in scheduled times

**After v3.39.59**:
- ✅ User schedules 4:30 PM → Shows 4:30 PM in admin  
- ✅ Proper Cancun timezone handling (`-05:00`)
- ✅ Accurate scheduled QR times in admin dashboard

## 🔄 Impact

**Seller Dashboard**: ✅ No changes (was already working correctly)
**Passes Page (PayPal)**: ✅ Now shows correct Cancun times  
**Admin Dashboard**: ✅ Displays accurate scheduled QR times
**QStash Scheduling**: ✅ Processes at correct Cancun times

## 🛡️ User Experience
