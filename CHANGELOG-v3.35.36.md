## ELocalPass CSV Import - Unique Email Constraint Fix

### 🚨 Critical Bug Fix

**Root Cause Identified**
The issue wasn't validation logic - it was a database constraint violation!

```prisma
model Affiliate {
  email String @unique  // <-- This was blocking imports!
}
```

**The Problem:**
- 113 affiliates had missing emails (null/empty values)
- Database unique constraint rejected multiple null emails
- Import failed for these affiliates despite "valid" preview

### 🔧 Technical Solution

**Unique Placeholder Email Generation**
- Missing emails now get unique placeholders: `missing-email-row-X-timestamp-random@placeholder.local`
- Guarantees database unique constraint compliance
- Preserves data integrity while ensuring 100% import success

**Enhanced Logic**
- Skip duplicate checking for placeholder emails
- Proper annotation of missing vs invalid emails
- Maintains data quality tracking through color annotations

### 📊 Expected Results

**Before v3.35.36:**
- Preview: 464 valid → Import: 351 success, 113 database errors
- Missing emails caused unique constraint violations

**After v3.35.36:**
- Preview: 464 valid → Import: 464 success, 0 database errors
- Missing emails get unique placeholders + red annotations
- Invalid emails get red annotations for correction

### 🎯 Data Quality Management

**Red Annotations Created For:**
- Missing emails → Placeholder generated, marked for follow-up
- Invalid email formats → Original invalid text preserved, marked for correction
- Missing names, first names, last names → Marked for completion

**Placeholder Email Format:**
```
missing-email-row-23-1703789123456-abc123def@placeholder.local
```

### 🔍 Technical Details

- **Row number tracking**: Easy to identify which CSV row had missing email
- **Timestamp**: Prevents collisions during bulk imports
- **Random suffix**: Additional uniqueness guarantee
- **Special domain**: Clear identification of placeholder emails

This fix ensures 100% CSV import success while maintaining complete data quality visibility through the annotation system.
