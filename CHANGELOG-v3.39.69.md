# ELocalPass v3.39.69 - Fix Missing Discount Tracking for Immediate QRs

## 🐛 **CRITICAL FIX: Missing Discount Tracking for Immediate QRs**

### Issue Identified
**Problem**: User reported that immediate QRs (created right away, not scheduled) were not showing discount amounts in the main analytics table, even when created with discount codes.

**Example**: 
- User created QR with discount code immediately 
- Cost showed: $0.60 (after discount)
- **Missing**: No indication that a discount was applied
- **Expected**: Discount column showing the discount amount

**Root Cause**: Previous v3.39.68 only added discount tracking to the **scheduled QR table**, but immediate QRs appear in the main **analytics table**, which was missing discount tracking.

## ✅ **Complete Immediate QR Discount Tracking Added**

### **Main Analytics Table Enhanced**
**Interface Updated**:
```typescript
interface QRAnalytics {
  // ... existing fields
+ discountAmount: number
}
```

**Table Column Added**:
- ✅ **New "Discount" Column** after "Cost" column
- ✅ **Green `-$X.XX`** formatting for discounts  
- ✅ **`-`** shown when no discount applied
- ✅ **Proper currency formatting** consistent with scheduled QRs

### **Analytics API Enhanced**
**Data Mapping Updated**:
```javascript
const analytics = filteredQRCodes.map(qr => ({
  // ... existing fields
+ discountAmount: qr.analytics?.discountAmount || 0,
}))
```

### **Immediate QR Creation Fixed**
**PayPal Success Route**:
```javascript
await prisma.qRCodeAnalytics.create({
  data: {
    // ... existing fields
+   discountAmount: orderRecord.discountAmount || 0,
  }
})
```

### **CSV Export Updated**
**Headers Enhanced**:
```javascript
const headers = [
  "QR Code", "Customer Name", "Customer Email", "Guests", "Days", 
- "Cost", "Seller", ...
+ "Cost", "Discount", "Seller", ...
]
```

**Data Mapping**:
```javascript
const csvData = analytics.map(qr => [
  // ... existing fields
+ qr.discountAmount > 0 ? qr.discountAmount : 0,
])
```

### **UI Improvements**
- ✅ **Table Width**: Increased from 1800px to 1900px for new column
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Maintains horizontal scroll functionality
- ✅ **Consistent Styling**: Matches scheduled QR table design

## 🎯 **Files Modified**

### **Frontend**:
- `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx`: Added Discount column with green formatting
  - Updated QRAnalytics interface  
  - Added table header and data cells
  - Updated CSV export functionality
  - Increased table width for new column

### **Backend**:
- `app/api/admin/analytics/route.ts`: Include discountAmount in API response
- `app/api/paypal/success/route.ts`: Store discount in immediate QR analytics

### **Database**: 
- No schema changes needed (already added in v3.39.68)

## ✅ **Expected Results**

### **Main Analytics Table** (`/admin/analytics`):
| Customer | QR Code | Details | Cost | **Discount** | Seller | Location | Created | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|------|**-----------**|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| joey terler | PASS_175... | 1 guest, 1 day | $0.60 | **-$0.40** | Lawrence Taylor | NYC | 7/23/2025 | Active |

### **Immediate QRs**: ✅ **Now show discount amounts**  
### **Scheduled QRs**: ✅ **Continue showing discount amounts**  
### **CSV Export**: ✅ **Includes discount data**  
### **Complete Tracking**: ✅ **Payment → Order → Analytics (all with discount data)**
