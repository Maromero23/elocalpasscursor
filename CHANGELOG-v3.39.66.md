# ELocalPass v3.39.66 - Restore Cost Tracking After Date Fix

## ðŸ’° Restore Cost Tracking Throughout System

### Added Back Cost Tracking (Without Breaking Date Logic)
**Issue**: After fixing the scheduled QR date issue in v3.39.65, the cost tracking functionality was missing, causing:
- Scheduled QR admin table missing Cost column
- Analytics showing $0.00 instead of actual price

**Solution**: Restore cost tracking functionality while preserving the working date logic.

## âœ… Changes Made

### Database Schema:
- âœ… **Added `amount` field** to `ScheduledQRCode` database model
- âœ… **Database Updated**: Via `prisma db push`

### PayPal QR Creation:
- âœ… **Store Cost**: Added `amount: orderRecord.amount` in scheduled QR creation
- âœ… **Both Routes**: Updated success and webhook routes

### Admin Interface:
- âœ… **Cost Column**: Added Cost column to scheduled QR admin table
- âœ… **Currency Formatting**: Proper USD formatting with `formatCurrency()`
- âœ… **API Data**: Updated scheduled QRs API to include amount field

### Analytics Creation:
- âœ… **PayPal QRs**: Use stored `amount` from scheduled QR
- âœ… **Seller QRs**: Continue using calculated price
- âœ… **Consistent Logic**: `scheduledQR.configurationId === 'default' ? scheduledQR.amount : calculatedPrice`

## ðŸŽ¯ Results

**Scheduled QR Table**: âœ… Shows cost column with proper formatting  
**Analytics Table**: âœ… Shows correct cost for all QRs (no more $0.00)  
**Date Logic**: âœ… Preserved working date functionality from v3.39.65  
**Cost Preservation**: âœ… Cost tracked from PayPal payment to final analytics

**Deployment Notes**: Cost tracking is now fully restored while maintaining the correct date scheduling functionality.
